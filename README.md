**ü§© Interfaces for humans ü§©**

Throughout this module, you were able to train a powerful prediction model, and put in production an API to expose your model to the world.

It is time to create an interface to allow regular Internet users to play with your predictions üåç

In this unit, you will learn how to create a website leveraging your **TaxiFare** üöï API in order to allow anyone to anticipate the cost of a ride in NYC.

## Unit challenges

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Static front for the API**
- Let's see how to plug your API to an existing static website

**2Ô∏è‚É£ TaxiFare website**
- We will use **streamlit** in order to create a user interface allowing to use our **TaxiFare** üöï model predictions
- And deploy the user interface to production using **Streamlit Cloud**

**‚ñ∂Ô∏è It is pitch time**
- Let's get ready for the pitches! üéâ

[//]: # ( challenge tech stack: )

[//]: # ( challenge instructions )

In the previous challenges, we updated our code to:
- **Train a model** at scale from the Kaggle New York City Taxi Fare Prediction dataset
- Build a containerized **Prediction API** allowing to make predictions based on this model
- Deploy our API on **Google Cloud Run** to make it available to the world üåç

We have a live API allowing developers all over the world to predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City üéâ

Now, we want to allow users all over the internet to be able to use our model in order to make a fare amount prediction, not just developers.

In order to do that, we are going to create a website allowing regular users to interact with our model.

Let's add a **Front-End** (website) on top of our **API** in order to visualize our predictions.

# First, let's create a new project

For now, all the code that we have been using for data exploration (notebooks), model training and building our prediction API is contained in a single project.

We are going to create a separate project for our website in order to keep things organised.

ü§î Why would we want to split our code into 2 projects ?

üëâ Separating the code for the model training + prediction API from the code of the website will allow the package for the website to be very light
üëâ Using separate projects will also ease the deployment of the interface

Actually, the package for our website will not require to contain any Data Science related code, since the website will be using our own API in order to make predictions.

Splitting the code between training/prediction and website has several benefits:
- We will be able to deploy our small package on light hosting solutions such as **GitHub Pages** and **Streamlit Cloud**, which can operate for free üíµ
- Splitting the complexity will allow other team of developers (for example web developers) to work with us without requiring any Data Science related knowledge
- It follows the web development pattern of separating the **Front-End** code (the website) from the **Back-End** code (the service), both communicating through an **API**

In this exercise, we are going to clone a repository containing an existing Taxi Fare website and modify it in order to plug it to our **Prediction API**.

This will give us an overview of what can be done in order to expose an API.

We will create a new project directory for the code of our website. This directory will be located inside of our *projects directory* where we store all of our GitHub repositories: `~/code/<user.github_nickname>`.

Then in the next challenge, we will code our own website from scratch with Streamlit üéâ And this second website will also have a project of its own...

# Let's go!

Let's use the [Le Wagon homemade TaxiFare frontend](https://github.com/lewagon/taxi-fare-interface) repository in order to plug [this Front-End](https://lewagon.github.io/taxi-fare-interface/index.html) to our **Prediction API**.

We will start by creating a duplicate template of this repository on our own GitHub account, by clicking on the `Use this template` button in the page of the repository on GitHub or [using this link](https://github.com/lewagon/taxi-fare-interface/generate).

üëâ **VERY IMPORTANT** we need to make our new repository a **PUBLIC REPOSITORY**, otherwise the **GitHub Pages** hosting solution that we want to introduce for this exercise will not work.

üëâ Let's name this repository `taxi-fare-interface`.

Now that we have a `taxi-fare-interface` repository on our GitHub account, we can clone it in order to modify it.

Let's go into your code folder:

``` bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
```

Let's clone our GitHub `taxi-fare-interface` repository:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:<user.github_nickname>/taxi-fare-interface.git
```

And step inside in order to work on it:

``` bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/taxi-fare-interface
```

Now, we will follow the instructions from the [taxi-fare-interface](https://github.com/lewagon/taxi-fare-interface) repository in order to plug our **Prediction API** to the website!

Let's:

üëâ Run our Front-End locally.

*Hint*: use python in order to server your website with the following command, then go to http://localhost:8000/

``` bash
python -m http.server
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you can see an error related to CORS, you may want to verify several things:
- Is your API endpoint __defined correctly__? You can use the Le Wagon one (look at the bottom of the challenge description)
- Is the endpoint starting with __https__ - secure protocol?
- Go to Inspect element :point_right:  Network :point_right: click on __disable cache__ (will look differently on different browsers, but you should see a checkbox just below the tabs) - you will not store any memory from previous loads of the page within your browser
- Try it out in the __incognito window__ - if it works, it means the request is affected by your browser settings or extensions, don't worry about it for now

üëâ Deploy our Front-End on **Github Pages**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Getting a 404 error on GH pages? Wait for 5 minutes, sometimes GitHub needs time in order to detect the `index.html` and deploy it as the main root file of the static website.

Head towards `http://yourgithuburl.com/yourapp/index.html` :ok_hand:

*Hint*: alternatively, you may use this Le Wagon **Prediction API URL** if you you do not have one in production: https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/

‚ÑπÔ∏è You can try this HTTP request in your browser: https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict?pickup_datetime=2012-10-06%2012:10:20&pickup_longitude=40.7614327&pickup_latitude=-73.9798156&dropoff_longitude=40.6513111&dropoff_latitude=-73.8803331&passenger_count=2
